# Geidel Guerra Website

> My personal website.

This website is the must up to date source of data about my work experience and skills. It is also
a place to implement and showcase whacky ideas.

My ideal scenario is to update the data here and sync it to other websites like LinkedIn, Indeed, etc auto-magically.
Check back later if you don't see any of that yet. All sync adapters will be in here somewhere. Also I will auto generate a PDF CV from the data.

You are free to use this code as a template for your own website.
