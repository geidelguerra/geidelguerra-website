  "about": "My name is Geidel Guerra. I'm a self taught developer with some formal studies, interested in low-level programming and making games.\n\nA bit of condensed history about me: I started learning to code using Macromedia Flash 8's offline help, making a phone book app to store phone numbers of StarCraft players (back then we used dialup peer to peer connections to play using phone numbers). I did some other stuff I don't remember. Fast forward in time, after finishing school (IT Bachelor) and dropping out of University in third year (IT Engineer) my first job was making games with Unity. After that I have been developing web applications that range from simple portfolio websites to complex e-commerce multi-tenancy Saas, command line tools to automate processes, browser extensions, configuring CI pipelines and Linux servers.\n\nI'm a fast learner (everybody says that), highly autonomous and self motivated. I have a broad set of skills that makes me easy to align to any kind of task and the will to specialize in depth if needed.\n\nCurrently learning C and how to make games. Next will be games in assembly (you read that correctly).",
